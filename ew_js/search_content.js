It may be best to ask yourself this: \"Can I go 2 days, 3 days, a week without thinking about or being involved my Performing Art?”   If the answer is YES , then you’ve found the greatest therapy, the best way to relieve the stress of your daily career.  Join a local choir, band or theatre group.  Attend local and traveling peformances when they come to town.  You’ll always appreciate the work that goes into a quality performance. If your answer is NO , you can’t get through the day without your Art, then it’s in your DNA.  You’ll only be happy molding your career around your lifestyle.  You belong in the Performing Arts! -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - The first concern many people have is earning a paycheck in the Performing Arts.  There are jobs for those who are perpared to meet the challenges ahead.  You have numerous options when it comes to a life in the Arts.  Not every career in the Performing Arts leads to being on stage or in a public school classroom.  There are well-paying careers teaching privately, working backstage in theaters, designing productions and working in Performing Arts management. This site gives you a good breakdown of many of the other options in the Arts: The Art Career Project   If you were planning to be a professional athlete, you’d spend countless hours practicing your skills, attending sports camps and watching your favorite sport so you could model those who have already made the leap to the big leagues.  If you wanted to be a high level scientist, you’d take every STEM class your school offered and attend science workshops.  A career in the Performing Arts needs to have the same type of preparation. Your first step to your future is to set a priority on your preparation.  While in Middle and High School, take as many Performing Arts classes as feasible.  That is, if you’re in Band, take Choir, do a Theatre production, …  All Performing Arts classes reinforce and expand the skills you’re learning in your primary discipline.  Go to as many professional and semi-professional performances as you can.  Many local and touring companies offer “Backstage Experiences” to students.  Look on-line for any volunteer opportunities with Performing Arts groups. Whichever disipline, Dance, Music or Theatre, is your destiny, it’s always best to experience the other disciplines as well.  Artists do not live in a bubble.  We grow in our Art through all of the experiences we achieve in all the Arts.   If you’re planning to attend college with a ‘traditional’ degree program, visit college websites to view the prerequisites and audition expectations for admission.  If college is not in your future, you can still have a life in the Arts.  In fact, your work in High School may be even more important to your success.  To help plan for your life in the Arts, earn your Honors Diploma in the Arts.   Here’s a breakdown of many of the things you should be thinking about as you prepare for your career in the Performing Arts. - Dance - Most people with Dance careers have begun their training at an earlier, pre-teen age.  People can start later, but they need to look for the best training possible in order to be ready.  Local store front studios can be a good experience, but many of them do not go into the depth of technique and Artistry needed to compete for jobs at a professional level.  Many of the careers in Dance are listed and described here. You should look for studios and academies that are affiliated with local professional Dance companies.  These Dance educators know what is required to fulfill the needs of a professional performing ensemble.  They can also help you understand the need for nutrition and wellness training in Dance.  The associated Dance companies often provide opportunities for students to perform with company dancers in major venues.  During your training, experience as many types of movement as feasible.  Look for other student dancers who will work with you as you try your hand at choreography.  Attend multi-week intensive summer workshops sponsored by local and non-local companies that will give you the chance to learn different approaches to Dance.   Many colleges sponsor College Experience and Practice Audition Days.  Theses are great oppurtunties to see what goes on in a college Dance program, meet college instructors and talk to other sudents like yourself considering a career in Dance. After High School, you may be offered a Dance Internship\/Pre-Professional position for more extensive training.  If not, find a college that has a well established Dance program and a track record of placing dancers in professional situations.  A college Dance experience can also provide you with the added time needed for your body and emotions to mature.  You’ll also be able to take classes that will assist you in your post-dance career.   A Dance audition is necessary for admission to college Dance programs. - Music - A Music career can be the easiest to think about, but is often the least planned for in High School.  Just being in your High School Band or Choir is not enough to be prepared for a college Music career.  Even if you’re not planning on the ‘traditional college’ music degree, you can’t wait until after High School to begin your preparation.  Regardless of what direction you’re planning, nothing beats private lessons.  Find a quality private teacher to help you understand the technique needed for your voice or instrument.   Take advantage Solo and Ensemble competitions offered in your state.  Many colleges sponsor Honor Bands, Choirs, Orchestras, Practice Audition Days, ….  Theses are great oppurtunties to see what goes on in a college Music program, meet college instructors and talk to other sudents like yourself considering a career in Muisc. College music students are required to graduate with a level of piano proficiency.  Learning basic keyboard skills while in High School will help lower your college class requirements.   Don’t restrict yourself to one kind of Music group.  Join other Music ensembles around your school.  Music is Music.  Everyone uses the same skills, just in a different approach.  Learning a new instrument or learning to sing will help you understand your primary instrument at a whole new level.  Many of the different careers in Music are listed described here. Music Theory and Sight-Singing skills are the make or break classes for college Music students.  If your High School offers Music Theory, take it.  If not, look for locations on-line that you can learn the basics of Music composition.  EVERY Music student has to be able to sight-sing.  That includes those who are not training as voice majors.  If you don’t consider yourself a singer, you have to get over it.  Join your High School Choir.  Work on identifying intervals and qualities of chords.   A Music audition is necessary for admission to college Music programs.  - Theatre - College Theatre programs generally have one of two approaches to admissions.  Either it’s highly competitive from the beginning where each student must audition for a few select spots or all students are admitted without an audition to the Theatre program.  These students must undergo a review of their work after the first semester or year to see if they will be allowed to continue with the program.  Neither approach is better than the other. To begin your training in Theatre, whether on-stage or backstage, you need to read, see or perform as much as possible to build your repertoire of plays and characters.  Participating in your High School Drama classes and productions are a big help, even shows that may not be your favorite.  Take any position offered: on-stage, backstage or front-of-house.  Every experience builds your understanding of the craft of Theatre.   Many colleges sponsor College Experience and Practice Audition Days.  Theses are great oppurtunties to see what goes on in a college Theatre program, meet college instructors and talk to other sudents like yourself considering a career in Theatre. Many aspects of Theatre involve the need for cross-disciplines with the other Art forms.  Take a Dance class.  Learn to sing. Take a Visual Arts class.  Take a writing class.  These other Art forms not only will help you build your skill set, they will also help you decide on where you want to be in the Theatre world: Acting, Playwriting, Production Design and Technology, Stage Management, Marketing, ….  Many of the different careers in Theatre are listed and described  here. Don’t limit yourself to just your High School.  Participate in local and community productions.  Test the waters in styles of theatre that you’re not comfortable with.  From Ancient Greek to Avant Garde, all Theatre is about the human condition.  You’ll grow from each new experience.  It’s most important that you auditon for shows that push your skill level.  An actor that only plays it safe, doing the same thing over and over again, never grows.  You may not be cast in some of these shows, but you’ll leave the audition knowing more about what is expected to achieve at a higher level.  You’ll also become a familar face and more likely to be involved with the company in the future.  Look for local professional and semi-professional theatre groups that host workshops or student internships.  Immerse yourself in all things Theatre. Many colleges require an audition to be accepted into the Theatre Department.  Those who don’t require an auditon at first, will accept you as a general Theare Major.  You will be required to have an acceptable portfolio of work\/auditon to remain in the program after the first year. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -     Above all else, remember that a career in the Arts is not a job, it’s a lifestyle.","tags":"","url":"performing-arts-careers.html","UUID":"A859691D7592456E81DF300B92D5DC78"},{"title":"Canal Winchester Performing Arts","text":" Canal Winchester Performing Arts Collective Building a Community of Life-Long Artists Canal Winchester Performing Arts Calendar 2022-2023 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ These performances are currently on the school calendar for the Canal Winchester Performing Arts Department.

The department is committed to creating excellence in Music Education using the Academic Content Standards laid down by the Ohio Department of Education .  While not officially an Advanced Placement Class, most of the course concepts and assignments are taken from the AP Music Theory curriculum.     Compositions will range from a few measures to 36 or more measures.  The course grade is a composite of the student’s  ability to follow the assignments’ goals and their grade for assigned on-line homework.  Each composition and on-line assignment maybe resubmitted as many times as necessary to achieve mastery of the concept.  The recorded grade will be changed to reflect the mastery. By the end of Beginning Music Theory\/Song Writing Class , students are expected to become proficient at using all major key signatures and scales, all popular meter signatures, treble and bass clefs and classic progression. The class will create melodies using harmonic and non-harmonic tones and will be able to choose the appropriate chords to accompany their compositions.  By the end of Advanced Music Theory\/Song Writing Class , students are expected to become proficient at using all minor key signatures and scales, non-popular meter signatures, secondary dominants, non-diatonic progressions and extended harmonies.  The class will create melodies using harmonic and non-harmonic tones and will be able to choose the appropriate chords to accompany their compositions.  Music Theory students may use the department MIDI lab, their personal devices and the school owned Chrome Books throughout the course.  With the constant developments in software, it’s impossible to list all the programs available to our students.  The class is encouraged to search out new programs and bring them to the class’ attention.   Primarily, software will fall into four categories.  The Music Theory MIDI Lab is equiped with the first software noted. The others listed are just a few of the personal options.  1) Music Notation -   Sibelius First (Free download, Mac and PC), Finale ($, Mac and PC), Noteflight (Free, Web based, ChromeBook friendly)  2) Sound Editing  -  GarageBand (Free download, Mac), FL Studio ($, Mac and PC), Audio Tool (ChromeBook App)   3) Music Accompaniment  - Band In A Box ($, Mac and PC), Chordbot ($, iOS and Android App) 4) Sound Recording -  Pro Tools First   (Free download, Mac and PC), Audacity (Free download, Mac and PC), Numerous ChromeBook Recording Apps  It is vital that all Notation software be able to export and print the composition.  All software must be able to import and export MIDI files.  Finale         Sibelius         Band In A Box                 Audacity GarageBand        FL Studio               Chrome App Store The online resources,  www.musictheory.net  and www.learnmusictheory.net will be used to re-enforce the classroom lessons and as graded homework assignments.    For Homework Assignments Click Here Music Theory\/Song Writing Class Rules and Grading Policy Are you thinking about a career in Music?

Extended   X 7 Chords - Generally, it boils down to adding the next note in the Triad Order: A-C-E-G-B-D-F-A- ….  So the raw Extended 7 for A would be: A-C-E- G ; the raw  B  chord would be B-D-F- A ; ….  It’s like spelling V 7 chords.  The only difference is the formula\/alterations used.  The basic letter names will always stay the same as the raw chord, but you’ll add more # ’s and b ’s to create the correct major 3rd or minor 3rd distance beteween pitches.   To review my notes on these chords and their fomulas,  check here .  Don’t forget that the formula of the 7th of a chord, that single note that is added as the 7th is:  The Major 7th note is a half step down for the root. Ex. C down to B The Minor 7th note is a whole step (2 half steps) down from the root. Ex. C down to Bb The Diminished 7th note is a step and a half (3 half steps) down from the root. Ex. C down to Bbb You can also find this explained in the Music Theory Packet on pages: Diatonic Seventh Chords , The Dominant Seventh and Extended Harmonies . The extended  X 7 chords come in 7 different types. Click on the mp3 to hear the chord built on C. Type = Formula: Chord Name built on the root C = Chord Members Major 7 = Major Triad with a Major 7th: Cmj 7 = C-E-G- B   mp3 Minor 7 = Minor Triad with a Minor 7th: Cm 7 = C-Eb-G- B b    mp3 Dominant 7 (V 7 ) = Major Triad with a Minor 7th: C 7 = C-E-G- B b    mp3 Half Diminished  7 = Diminished Triad with a Minor 7th: Cm 7b5 = C-E b -G b - B b    mp3 Fully Diminished  7 = Diminished Triad with a Diminished 7th: C o7 = C-E b -G b - B bb    mp3 Minor-Major 7 = Minor Triad with a Major 7th: CmMj 7 = C-E b -G- B   mp3 Augmented 7 = Augmented Triad with a Minor 7th  C 7#5 = C-E-G # - Bb   mp3 Applying this concept to the chords of the key of C would create the following: Cmj 7 - Dm 7 - Em 7 - Fmj 7 - G 7 - Am 7 - Bm 7b5   I is  Xmj 7  - ii is  Xm 7 - iii is  Xm 7 - IV is  Xmj 7 - V is   X 7 - iv is  Xm 7 - vii º is  Xm 7b5 Hear these chords in order. This pattern holds true for EVERY Major key. Note that the Minor-Major 7 , the Augmented 7 and the Fully Diminished 7 are not default chords to a Major key.  They can apear in a Minor key, but that’s another discussion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Extended  X 9 Chords - The next step is to add the 9 to the chord.  This note is, again, the next note in the Triad Order.  You keep the 7 and add the next letter.  A-C-E-G- B in raw form.  This note is also the diatonic second above the root note: In some type of A Chord,  the 9 would be some type of B.  Remember the 9 , by default, is always a whole step above the root.   (There are chords that are called X add9 .  These chords would not contain the 7 .   You’d find just the basic triad in some form and the whole step above the root.  Note that is not written X +9 .  That’s a different chord.) The extended 9 chords come in 4 different types.  Click on the  mp3  to hear the chord built on C. Type = Formula: Chord Name built on the root C = Chord Members Major 9 = Major Triad with a Major 7th and a whole step above the root: Cmj 9 = C-E-G-B- D   mp3 Minor 9 = Minor Triad with a Minor 7th and a whole step above the root: Cm 9 = C-E b -G-B b - D   mp3 Dominant  9 (V 9 ) = Major Triad with a Minor 7th and a whole step above the root: C 9 = C-E-G-B b - D   mp3 Minor-Major 9 = Minor Triad with Major 7th and a whole step above the root: CmMj 9 = C-E b -G-B- D   mp3 9’s are generally not added to Diminished and Augmented Triads.   They have enough tension on their own . Applying this concept to the chords of the key of C would create the following: Cmj 9 - Dm 9 - Em 7 - Fmj 9 - G 9 - Am 9 - Bm 7b5   I  is  Xmj 9  -  ii  is  Xm 9  -  iii  is  Xm 7  -  IV  is  Xmj 9  -  V  is  X 9  -  iv  is  Xm 9  -  vii º is  Xm 7b5 Hear these chords in order . Caution: It takes a lot of practice to hear the difference between Diatonic 7 ’s and Diatonic 9 ’s. Note that you do not add a 9 to the iii chord if you’re staying Diatonic.  That added note, being a whole step above the root, would be F # .  This pattern holds true for EVERY Major key.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there more Extensions?   Yes, and we’ll talk about a couple.  Most of the other ones get more tense than the average High School Music theory class needs, so we don’t compose with them.  For your information: To get an 11 , keep the 7 and 9 , and add the next note, raw letters: A-C-E-G-B- D .  A 13  keeps the 7 , 9 and 11 , adds one more and gives you every note of the scale, raw letters: A-C-E-G-B-D- F .  You can also have altered added tones, ie. b9 , #11 , ….. That’s for another time. Added  X 6 Chords .  In this case, you take the basic triad and add a whole step above the 5th of the chord.  The 6  can be added to Major or Minor Triads .   In all cases, the added note will be a MAJOR 6th above the root, regardless of the quality of the triad.  An added 6 to the chord provides some color, but is more stable than adding a 7 .   Click on the  mp3  to hear the chord built on C. Type = Formula: Chord Name built on the root C = Chord Members 6 = Major Triad and a whole step above the 5th: C 6 = C-E-G- A   * This chord is just called a 6 , (Six) NOT Major Six.  I know it doesn’t quite makes sense why, but that’s just the way it is.   mp3 m 6 = Minor Triad and a whole step above the 5th: Cm 6 = C-Eb-G- A  * This chord is called a m 6 , (Minor Six).  Don’t refer to it as a b6 (Flat Six).  That’s something different.   mp3 Applying this concept to the chords of the key of C would create the following: C 6 - Dm 6 - Em - F 6 - G 6 - Am - B o I  is X 6  -  ii  is  Xm 6  -  iii  is  Xm  -  IV  is  X 6  -  V  is  X 6  -  iv  is  Xm  -  vii º is  X o Hear these chords in order.   Same thing.  It takes time. This pattern holds true for EVERY Major key.  Note that you do not add a default  6 to the iii or vi chord of a Major key, if you’re staying Diatonic.  That added note, being a whole step above the 5th, would be out of the key signature. Staying in the key, you’d have to say: Em b6 , as an example. More on that later.  You also don’t use them on Diminished Chords. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Added  X 69 Chords,  (Pronounced 6 - 9, not sixty-nine). A chord with a 69 is a chord where you substitute a 6 for the 7 in a 9 chord.  That is, raw letters: A-C-E-F-B.  A 69 adds more color than just a 6 , but is still more stable than a 7 or 9 .  We only use them with Major or Minor Triads .   Click on the  mp3  to here the chord built on C. Type = Formula: Chord Name built on the root C = Chord Members 69 = Major Triad with a whole step above the 5th and a whole step above the root: C 69 = C-E-G- A-D   * This makes a good chord for the final measure of a song.   mp3 m 69 = Minor Triad with a whole step above the 5th and a whole step above the root:  Cm 69  = C-E b -G- A-D  * This chord has the most tension of the chords that contain an added  6 .   mp3 Applying this concept to the chords of the key of C would create the following: C 69 - Dm 69 - Em - F 69 - G 69 - Am - B o I  is X 69  -  ii  is  Xm 69  -  iii  is  Xm  -  IV  is  X 69  -  V  is  X 69  -  iv  is  Xm  -  vii º is  X o Hear these chords in order.   Give it time. This pattern holds true for EVERY Major key.  Note that you do not add a default  69 to the iii or vi chord of a Major key, if you’re staying Diatonic.  Staying in the key, you’d have to say: Em b6b9 , as an example. ————————————————————————————————————————— If you compile all of the Diatonic default extensions from above, you get these options for all MAJOR key triads: I - Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 ii -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 ,  Xm 6 ,  Xm 69 iii -  Xm 7 IV -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 V -  X 7 ,  X 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 vi -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 viiº -  Xm 7b5 If you’re composing in MINOR key, it can get fairly complicated if you take into account the 3 kinds of MINOR ( Pure , Harmoninc , Melodic ).  These are the Diatonic default extensions in PURE   minor triads: i -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 ii º -  Xm 7b5 III -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 iv -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 ,  Xm 6 ,  Xm 69 v -  Xm 7 VI -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 VII  - Xm 7 These are the Diatonic default extensions in  HARMONIC minor triads:  i -  XmMj 7 ,  XmMj 9   ii º -  Xm 7b5 III + -  X 7#5 iv -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 ,  Xm 6 ,  Xm 69 V -  X 7 ,  X 9 VI -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69 # viiº -  X o7 These are the Diatonic default extensions in Ascending and Descending   MELODIC minor triads:  i -  XmMj 7 ,  XmMj 9 ,  Xm 6 ,  Xm 69   ii  -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 6   (Ascending)   ii º -  Xm 7b5   (Descending) III +  -  Xmj 7#5   (Ascending)   III -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69   (Descending) IV -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69   (Ascending)   iv -  Xm 7 ,  Xm 9 ,  Xm 6 ,  Xm 69   (Descending) V -  X 7 ,  X 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69   (Ascending)   v -  Xm 7   (Descending) # viº  -  Xm 7b5   (Ascending)   VI -  Xmj 7 ,  Xmj 9 ,  X 6 ,  X 69   (Descending) # viiº -  X o7 , Xm 7b5   (Ascending)   VII   -  Xm 7   (Descending) Using other extensions on chords other than the ones listed above, ie.

Each year we have over 60 students participating in the program. The vast majority of these students have little to no formal Theatre training before joining class. The Department is committed to creating excellence in Theatre Education using the Academic Content Standards laid down by the  Ohio Department of Education .   So what is Performing Arts Class?  Well, a little bit of everything.  Our primary curriculum is a study of the Theatre craft.  Coursework includes: Improv and Scripted Work, Script writing and Character Analysis, Production and Design, Directing and Staging.  A small portion of the students in the class are really interested in a career in in Theatre, and while we work hard to prepare them for that life, the true emphasis is on the process that Theatre people go through to create the Art. Our first and primary goal to introduce the students to taking risks and making choices.  This is a skill that they will take with them to whatever career they choose.  It can only happen the student feels free to experiment in a welcoming and  non-competitive environment.   Assignments are a mix of solo and group work.  Many of these can be accomplished within the class time, some work is expected to be done outside of class.  Students are always given at least 3 days to prepare and submit their work.  The class is also graded on their daily participation and behavior.   By the end of the Performing Arts 1 (PA 1) class students will be able to define Theatre terms, understand the basics of staging and production design.  Each student has submitted their own Short-Short play inspired by a given prompt.  The student will have also worked in creative teams to produce shorts plays on given topics.  The class will have read and analyzed a famous play for plot, character and thematic aspects. Performing Arts 2 (PA 2) is a continuation of the PA 1 curriculum.  The class will build on the concepts from PA 1, though with more challenging expectations and higher goals. Additional projects will include Performance Art piece and a Silent Movie.  All students are encouraged to become involved in the after-school productions offered at Canal Winchester as well as those offered by our local community Theatre groups.
